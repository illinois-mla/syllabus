However, most scientific applications are more naturally expressed as regression problems: this presents both a challenge and an opportunity to the scientific ML community!  Also note that a regression problem can always be converted into a classification problem by binning the output (assuming you don't need infinite accuracy), which can be surprisingly effective.\n",

    "When learning a model $M$, our quantitative measure of how well it explains the data $D$ is the evidence $P(D\\mid M)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since unsupervised and supervised learning requires first learning the model, we could use the same measure, but a different measure is also useful: how well does $M$ explain unobserved data $D'$?  In other words, how well does the learned model generalize and offer predictive power?  In order to answer this question, in practice, you must hold back some of your observed data when learning the model and can then measure how well the model \"postdicts\" the held back data. The held back data is referred to as the **test sample** and this process is known as **cross validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the model and its parameters have some physical reality (for example, projectile motion modeled with Newtonian physics and parameterized by $g$, ...), these measures are essentially the same since the model is dictated by some independent reality and not chosen specifically to explain the observed data $D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when predicting future data is the main goal and there is no first-principles model available, the model and its parameters are essentially unconstrained and these two measures can easily diverge.  In particular, optimizing how well the model explains the observed data leads to **over-fitting** and poor ability to **generalize** to new data.\n",
